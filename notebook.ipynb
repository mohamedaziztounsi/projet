TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n","<p>Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's a little something for everyone at your Super Bowl party. Drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy for the sports fan. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding giant mechanical tigers</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It's a show, baby. And in this notebook, we're going to find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning our data a little, we're going to answer questions like:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>\n","<li>How does the game affect television viewership?</li>\n","<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?</li>\n","<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_684/img/left_shark.jpg\" alt=\"Left Shark Steals The Show\">\n","<em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/huntleypaton/16464994135/in/photostream/\">Left Shark Steals The Show</a>.

Going up to the highest combined scores at 74 and 75, we find two games featuring dominant quarterback performances.

We also have Super Bowl IX in New Orleans in 1975, whose 16-6 score can be attributed to inclement weather. The field was slick from overnight rain, and it was cold at 46 °F (8 °C), making it hard for the Steelers and Vikings to do much offensively. This was the second-coldest Super Bowl ever and the last to be played in inclement weather for over 30 years. The NFL realized people like points, I guess.</p>\n","<p><em>UPDATE: In Super Bowl LIII in 2019, the Patriots and Rams broke the record for the lowest-scoring Super Bowl with a combined score of 16

Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?\n","<p>The vast majority of Super Bowls are close games. Makes sense. Both teams are likely to be deserving if they've made it this far. The closest game ever was when the Buffalo Bills lost to the New York Giants by 1 point in 1991, which was  best remembered for Scott Norwood's last-second missed field goal attempt that went <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPFZCGgjDSg\">wide right</a></em>, kicking off four Bills Super Bowl losses in a row. Poor Scott. The biggest point discrepancy ever was 45 points (!) where Hall of Famer Joe Montana's led the San Francisco 49ers to victory in 1990, one year before the closest game ever.</p>\n","<p>I remember watching the Seahawks crush the Broncos by 35 points (43-8) in 2014, which was a boring experience in my opinion. The game was never really close. I'm pretty sure we changed the channel at the end of the third quarter. Let's combine our game data and TV to see if this is a universal phenomenon. Do large point differences translate to lost viewers? We can plot <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings\">household share</a> <em>(average percentage of U.S. households with a TV in use that were watching for the entire broadcast)</em> vs. point difference to find

10. Conclusion\n","<p>So most non-band musicians do 1-3 songs per halftime show. It's important to note that the duration of the halftime show is fixed (roughly 12 minutes) so songs per performance is more a measure of how many hit songs you have. JT went off in 2018, wow. 11 songs! Diana Ross comes in second with 10 in her medley in 1996.</p>\n","<p>In this notebook, we loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. We visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. We used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And we discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.</p>\n","<p>This year's Big Game will be here before you know it.
